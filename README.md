## Description

Using the search field on top of the page a user can search for a city and is presented with current and future conditions for that city. That city is then added to the search history below. Clicking an old search term will pull current and future conditions for that city.

"As a frequent traveler I want to be able to find weather information for cities I visit so that I can be better prepared for Mother Nature"

Available Data:

- Local Time
- Weather Icon (of conditions)
- The current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index.
- UV Index is color-coded indicating the conditions favorability. Per EPA's [UV Index](https://www.epa.gov/sunsafety/uv-index-scale-0)
- 7 Day forecast displaying temperature Highs and Lows, humidity, and weather icon.

### And responsive!
